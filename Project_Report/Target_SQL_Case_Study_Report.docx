from
first_year f
join second_year s
on f.year<s.Year
UNION ALL
select * from second_year
 
ANALYSIS:
●	The data indicates an increase of 137% in the yearly cost of orders in 2018 as compared to 2017.
Cost_of_orders in 2017 = 3669022
Cost_of_orders in 2018 = 8694734
Increase in cost_of_orders = 8694734 - 3669022 = 5025712
% change = (5025712 / 3669022) * 100 = 136.9%
●	This positive change owes to the increase in number of orders during 2018 as compared to 2017 as calculated earlier.

join `Target.orders` o on o.order_id=oi.order_id
join `Target.customers` c on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by 1
order by 4 desc

 

ANALYSIS: 
Average Freight Value (AFV) – High vs. Low:
●	Highest AFV:
○	RR : $42.98 – Smallest volume (52 shipments) but the highest freight cost, likely due to geographic remoteness.
●	Lowest AOV:
○	SP : $15.15 – Economies of scale from high shipment volumes.

●	SP and RJ maintain low average freight values despite their large shipment sizes.
●	Northern regions like RR and PB show a significant increase in average freight cost relative to their shipment count.
